   abstract = {Mass appraisal is widely considered an advanced frontier in the real estate valuation field. Performing mass appraisal entails the need to get access to base information conveyed by a large amount of transactions, such as prices and property features. Due to the lack of transparency of many Italian real estate market segments, our survey has been addressed to gather data from residential property advertisements. The dataset specifically focuses on property offer prices and dwelling energy efficiency. The latter refers to the label expressed and exhibited by the energy performance certificate. Moreover, data are georeferenced with the highest possible accuracy: at the neighborhood level for a 76.8% of cases, at street or building number level for the remaining 23.2%. Data are related to the analysis performed in Bonifaci and Copiello [1], about the relationship between house prices and building energy performance, that is to say, the willingness to pay in order to benefit from more efficient dwellings.},

The data sample relates to 64 housing units located in “Santa Lucia” and “Riviera di Chiaia” neighborhoods. It provides significant information on the urban structure of these neighborhoods. The variables are indicators elaborated from official data sources: real estate rental price, commercial area, maintenance status, number of floor level of housing unit, geographical position. The geographical position is expressed assigning a prefixed sequence of characters to each housing unit, so as to classify every housing unit as falling to a defined sub-area with homogeneous values. The urban area considered is subdivided in five sub-areas. The five subzones are homogeneous in terms of services and infrastructure qualification.},

The present real estate dataset contains 43 variables of repeat sales transactions, energy performance certificate (EPC) rating, index of multiple deprivation (IMD), and geographical location of properties in England and Wales involved in a total of 4,201 transactions from 1995 to 2012. This dataset enables researchers and practitioners to further explore important questions regarding the nexus between the real estate industry, sustainability levels, and socio-economic aspects. Due to the scarcity of publicly available quality real estate data, the dataset detailed in this article may play a relevant role by becoming easily discoverable, clearly explained, and structured to be ready to be used by researchers, analysts, and policymakers. The empirical analysis of the economic case for energy-efficient dwellings in the UK private rental market performed in Fuerst, et al. [1] is based on this dataset.},

   abstract = {This data article describes a holiday rental dataset from a medium-size cultural city destination. Daily rate and variables related to location, size, amenities, rating, and seasonality are highlighted as the main features. The data was extracted from Booking.com, legal registration of the accommodation (RTA) and Google Maps, among other sources. This dataset contains data from 665 holiday rentals offered as entire flat (rent per room was discarded), with a total of 1623 cases and 28 variables considered. Regarding data extraction, RTA is ordered by registration number, which is taken and, through a Google search with the following structure: “apartment registration no.Booking Seville”, the holiday rental profile in Booking.com is found. Then, it is verified that both the address of the accommodation and the registration number match in RTA and Booking.com, proceeding with data extraction to a Microsoft Excel's file. Google Maps is used to determine the minutes spent walking from the accommodation to the spot of maximum tourist interest of the city. A price index based on the average price per square meter of real estate per district is also incorporated to the dataset, as well as a visual appeal rating made by the authors of every holiday rental based on its Booking.com photos profile. Only cases with complete data were considered. A statistics summary of all variables of the data collected is presented. This dataset can be used to develop an estimation model of daily prices of stay in holiday rentals through predetermined variables. Econometrics methodologies applied to this dataset can also allow testing which variables included affecting the composition of holiday rentals' daily rates and which not, as well as determining their respective influence on daily rates.},

It includes a wide range of variables closely related to housing prices such as housing properties, local demographic characteristics, local amenities, and seasonal control variables. Various distance variables constructed in a geographic information system environment using public data are useful for exploring the environmental impact on housing prices. These data cover four metropolitan areas—Busan, Daegu, Daejeon, and Gwangju—and provide accurate information on their metropolitan structures distinct from the capital city, Greater Seoul. An empirical analysis performed by Ahn et al. [1] is based on this dataset.},
